// Skill is a loaded skill from a skill directory. The YAML frontmatter
// in the skill file provides name and description; the markdown body is
// the skill content injected into the system prompt when invoked. Dir
// is the path to the skill's directory, so the skill can reference its
// own files (scripts, references, templates) by relative path.
